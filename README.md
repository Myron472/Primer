# Primer
Primer is a program that computes prime numbers by using RegEx.

Abilities of the Primer:
1. Tell whether the number is prime or composite
2. Output prime number sequence from specific range setted up by user.

Several output methods are supported:
1. Output sequence in terminal window
2. Copy sequence to clipboard
3. Write sequence to a file

This program was inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/5vbk0TwkokM?si=MKmSf8uowrVRzesn) Matt Parker's video. I didn't make prime number search algorithm myself, I just made a convinient way to work with it.
